## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Position - Pre-Sprint
- ✅ Manager uploads instructions before sprint starts
- ✅ Recruiter sees instructions immediately
- ✅ Badge appears as "NEW"
- ✅ Recruiter views and badge disappears

### Scenario 2: Active Sprint - Mid-Flight
- ✅ Manager uploads instructions during active sprint
- ✅ Instructions appear alongside sprint progress
- ✅ Recruiter can view both sprint status and instructions
- ✅ No interference between features

### Scenario 3: Post-Sprint - Alongside Phase 2 Strategy
- ✅ Position has both Role Instructions and Phase 2 Strategy
- ✅ Both display correctly without conflicts
- ✅ Different styling distinguishes the two
- ✅ View tracking works independently

### Scenario 4: Multiple Recruiters
- ✅ Manager uploads instructions
- ✅ 5 recruiters assigned to position
- ✅ Each sees NEW badge
- ✅ As each views, count increases (1/5, 2/5, etc.)
- ✅ Badge disappears for each after viewing

### Scenario 5: Replace Instructions
- ✅ Manager removes existing instructions
- ✅ Manager uploads new file
- ✅ View count resets to 0
- ✅ NEW badge reappears for all recruiters

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- Access to Supabase Dashboard
- Database admin permissions
- Code deployment access

### Step-by-Step
1. **Run SQL migration** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Create storage bucket** named `role-instructions` (public)
3. **Set bucket policies** for authenticated uploads and public reads
4. **Deploy code changes** (no build changes required)
5. **Test with sample upload** as manager
6. **Verify recruiter view** as recruiter user
7. **Check audit logs** in database
8. **Monitor for errors** in browser console

**Estimated Deployment Time:** 15-20 minutes

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- **No new npm packages required**
- Uses existing Supabase client
- Uses existing Framer Motion for animations
- Uses existing Lucide React icons

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Fully supported
- Firefox: ✅ Fully supported
- Safari: ✅ Fully supported
- Mobile browsers: ✅ Fully supported

### Performance Considerations
- File size limited to 10 MB (configurable)
- JSONB used for efficient array operations
- Index created for faster queries
- Public URLs avoid download overhead
- Lazy loading of position data per tab

### Security Considerations
- Row-level security on storage bucket
- Authenticated uploads only
- Public reads (necessary for recruiters to view)
- Audit logging for accountability
- File type validation on client and server

## 📈 Future Enhancement Ideas

### Potential Improvements (Not Implemented)
- [ ] PDF format support
- [ ] Multiple file uploads per position
- [ ] Individual view timestamps per recruiter
- [ ] Email notifications when instructions uploaded
- [ ] Version history for replaced instructions
- [ ] Rich text editor instead of file uploads
- [ ] Templates for common role types
- [ ] Search/filter positions by instructions status
- [ ] Bulk upload for multiple positions

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Single file only** - Cannot upload multiple documents per position
2. **No version history** - Replacing instructions loses the old version
3. **File types limited** - Only .docx and .doc supported
4. **10 MB file limit** - Large documents must be compressed
5. **View tracking count only** - No individual timestamps shown
6. **No offline support** - Requires internet connection
7. **No real-time updates** - Requires page refresh to see badge disappear
