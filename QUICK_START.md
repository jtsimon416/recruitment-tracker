## âš¡ 3-Step Deployment

### STEP 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)

2. Copy this entire query and run it:

```sql
-- Add Role Instructions columns
ALTER TABLE positions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role_instructions_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role_instructions_uploaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role_instructions_viewed_by JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role_instructions_notes TEXT;

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_positions_role_instructions
ON positions(role_instructions_url)
WHERE role_instructions_url IS NOT NULL;
```

3. Click **RUN** - you should see "Success. No rows returned"

---

### STEP 2: Storage Setup (5 minutes)

1. Supabase Dashboard â†’ **Storage** â†’ **New bucket**
2. Enter:
   - Name: `role-instructions`
   - Public bucket: âœ… **CHECK THIS BOX**
3. Click **Create bucket**
4. Click on the bucket â†’ **Policies** â†’ **New Policy** â†’ **Custom**
5. Paste these 3 policies:

```sql
-- Policy 1: Uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'role-instructions');

-- Policy 2: Reads
CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'role-instructions');

-- Policy 3: Deletes
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'role-instructions');
```

6. Click **Review** â†’ **Save policy** for each one

### STEP 3: Deploy Code (5 minutes)

**The code is already written!** Just deploy:

# Or if deploying manually
npm run build
```

**Files that were modified:**

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Just Built

Managers can now:
- Upload kickoff notes for ANY position
- At ANY time (before/during/after sprint)
- Track who has viewed them
- Remove/replace as needed

Recruiters will:
- See instructions on their dashboard
- Get a "NEW" badge for unviewed docs
- Click once to view
- Badge auto-disappears after viewing

---

## ðŸ†˜ Quick Troubleshooting

### "Error uploading file"
â†’ Did you make the bucket **PUBLIC** in Step 2? That's the most common issue.

### "Can't see Role Instructions tab"
â†’ Are you logged in as a Manager/Director? Recruiters don't see this tab.

### "Badge doesn't disappear"
â†’ Refresh the page after clicking "View Instructions"

### "File won't upload"
â†’ Check file format (.docx or .doc only) and size (under 10 MB)

## ðŸ”„ Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, run this in SQL Editor:

ALTER TABLE positions
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role_instructions_url,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role_instructions_uploaded_at,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role_instructions_viewed_by,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role_instructions_notes;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_positions_role_instructions;
```

Then delete the `role-instructions` bucket in Storage.
